# Ideal LLM Retrieval System

## Overview
The Ideal LLM Retrieval System is an intelligent data processing and retrieval system that uses Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to take various types of user inputs (text, data, URLs) and provide accurate answers based on those inputs. By scraping or importing the provided data, chunking and embedding it, the system can efficiently store and retrieve relevant information to answer user questions.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Accepts text, data files, and URLs as input.
- **Data Processing**: Scrapes and organizes data from input URLs, then chunks it for optimal processing.
- **Embeddings Creation**: Converts text chunks into vector embeddings to capture their semantic meaning.
- **Vector Search**: Utilizes vector similarity search to match user queries with relevant data chunks.
- **Answer Generation**: Retrieves the most relevant information to formulate and present accurate answers.

## Project Flow
1. **Data Collection**: Data can be input directly or scraped from provided URLs.
2. **Data Chunking**: Data is divided into manageable chunks.
3. **Embedding**: Each chunk is embedded to capture semantic meaning using vector embeddings.
4. **Query Handling**: User inputs a query, which is also embedded.
5. **Vector Matching**: The system searches for the closest matching data chunks using vector similarity.
6. **Response Generation**: Relevant information is returned to the user as the final answer.

## Requirements
To build and run this system, you will need:
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the system.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the LLM capabilities.
- **Faiss**: Vector similarity search library to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.
- **Vector Database (VectorDB)**: To store vector embeddings for quick and scalable retrieval.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IdealLLM-Retrieval-System.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:
   - Register and get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
   - Set it as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
     ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- **Support for additional data formats**.
- **Improved user query handling** through advanced NLP techniques.
- **Scalable deployment** with cloud-based vector storage and enhanced caching.
